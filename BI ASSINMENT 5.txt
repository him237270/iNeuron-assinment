Q-1 Explain DAX.
ANS-DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used in Microsoft Power BI, Excel, and Analysis Services to define custom calculations and perform advanced data analysis. It is similar in syntax to Excel formulas but is optimized for data modeling and analysis.
DAX allows users to create powerful calculations and queries that can be used to analyze and visualize large datasets. It includes functions for aggregating data, filtering data, performing calculations, and more. Some examples of DAX functions include SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, COUNT, IF, SWITCH, and CALCULATE.
DAX formulas can be created using the formula bar in Power BI or Excel, or in the DAX editor in Analysis Services. They can be used to create measures, which are calculations that aggregate data, or calculated columns, which create new columns based on existing data.
DAX also includes a powerful concept called "context", which allows users to apply filters and define relationships between tables to perform calculations on subsets of data.
Overall, DAX is a powerful tool for performing complex data analysis and modeling, and is widely used by business analysts, data scientists, and other professionals to gain insights from large datasets




Q-2 Explain datasets, reports, and dashboards and how they relate to each other?
ANS-Datasets, reports, and dashboards are all important components of data analysis and visualization. They are interconnected and work together to provide a comprehensive view of data and insights to decision-makers.

A dataset is a collection of data that is organized in a specific format, typically in a spreadsheet or database. It contains all the raw data, which is usually too complex and unstructured to be analyzed directly. Datasets can be used to build reports and dashboards.

A report is a summary of the dataset, usually presented in a graphical or tabular format. Reports provide insights into the data by analyzing and summarizing it. They are typically designed to answer specific questions or to provide a summary of a particular aspect of the dataset.

A dashboard is a visual display of the most important information and insights from a dataset, typically presented in a single page or screen. Dashboards provide a real-time overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics, allowing decision-makers to quickly understand trends, identify patterns, and make informed decisions.

In other words, datasets are the raw materials of data analysis, reports are the processed output of data analysis, and dashboards are the visual representation of the most important aspects of data analysis. They all work together to provide a comprehensive view of data and insights to decision-makers. Datasets provide the data for reports and dashboards, reports provide analysis and insights, and dashboards provide a real-time overview of KPIs and metrics to help decision-makers monitor and make informed decisions.

Q-6 In Power BI visualization, what are Reading View and Editing view?
ANS-In Power BI, Reading View and Editing View are two different modes for viewing and interacting with reports and visualizations.
Reading View:
Reading View is a mode in which the user can view a published report and interact with its visualizations, but cannot make any changes to the report. In this mode, the user can filter and drill down into the data, but they cannot add or remove visualizations, modify the layout, or change any settings.
Editing View:
Editing View is a mode in which the user can modify the report by adding, removing, or modifying visualizations, changing the layout, adjusting the settings, or adding custom calculations. In this mode, the user can also add or edit data sources, create new measures, and define relationships between tables. The Editing View is typically used by report authors or developers to design and build reports.
In summary, Reading View is for end-users who want to view and interact with the report, while Editing View is for report authors or developers who want to modify the report.
