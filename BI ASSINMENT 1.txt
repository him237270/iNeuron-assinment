 Q -1     What do you mean by BI? Explain.
ANS- BI stands for Business Intelligence, which refers to the process of collecting, analyzing, and presenting data to support business decision-making.Business Intelligence involves using software tools and techniques to extract insights from various sources of data such as transactional systems, customer data, and marketing data. This data is then analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and relationships that can help businesses make informed decisions. 


Q -2      Explain Descriptive analytics?
ANS- Descriptive analytics is the type of data analysis that focuses on describing and summarizing data in a meaningful way. It involves the use of statistical and mathematical techniques to analyze large volumes of data and provide insights into past performance or historical trendsDescriptive analytics is used to understand what has happened in the past, and it provides a baseline for making informed decisions about the future. It helps to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, and it enables businesses to understand the performance of different departments, products, or services.


Q -3     Explain Predictive analytics?
ANS- Predictive analytics is a branch of data analytics that uses statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, and data mining to analyze historical and current data to make predictions about future events or behavior. It involves the use of data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning models to identify patterns and relationships in data and predict future outcomes with a certain degree of accuracy.
The predictive analytics process involves the following steps:Data collection: Collecting and preparing data for analysis is the first step in the predictive analytics process. This includes cleaning and transforming the data to ensure that it is accurate and relevant.Data analysis: The data is analyzed using statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, and data mining to identify patterns and relationships in the data.Model development: Once patterns and relationships have been identified, predictive models are developed using machine learning algorithms such as regression, decision trees, or neural networks. These models are trained on historical data to predict future outcomes.Model testing and validation: The predictive models are tested and validated using a separate set of data to ensure that they are accurate and reliable.Deployment: Once the models have been tested and validated, they are deployed in a production environment to make predictions about future events or behavior.Predictive analytics is used in a variety of applications, including marketing, finance, healthcare, and fraud detection. It can help businesses make better decisions, improve efficiency, and reduce risk.


Q -4      Explain perspective analytics?
ANS-Perspective analytics is a type of data analysis that seeks to understand and quantify the opinions, attitudes, and emotional states of people expressed through language, especially in written text. It involves using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze text data and extract insights on people's perspectives and opinions.
One of the main applications of perspective analytics is in understanding the sentiment of customers towards a product or service. By analyzing reviews, feedback, and comments, businesses can gain valuable insights into what their customers like and dislike, and make data-driven decisions to improve their products and services.Perspective analytics also has applications in social media monitoring and brand reputation management. By analyzing social media posts and comments, companies can monitor the public perception of their brand and identify potential issues or opportunities for engagement.Perspective analytics typically involves several steps, including data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and modeling. The preprocessing step involves cleaning and transforming the text data to prepare it for analysis. Feature extraction involves identifying relevant features or attributes of the text data that can be used to build predictive models. Modeling involves using machine learning algorithms to make predictions based on the extracted features.Overall, perspective analytics is a powerful tool for understanding people's perspectives and attitudes, and can be used to drive insights and decision-making across a wide range of industries and applications
